# Advent of Code 2025

I'm using Advent of Code 2025 to learn some (more) Rust.

Each day will have its own binary with a matching name and will read its input from `input/DD`.
To build and run the programs [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/):
```sh
# Build and run today's puzzle
just run
# Build and run the program for puzzle DD
just run DD
```

Examples can be used too.
```sh
# Use example/DD/N as input where DD is today's date
just example DD N
```
The default is to run today's first example, i.e. `N = 1`.
